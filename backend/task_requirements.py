"""What a task needs before it leaves a stage (docs/pipelines-v3.md, "The nine requirement kinds").

A requirement sits on a stage (every task that visits it) or on one visit (this task, this time). Each kind answers one
question for a task's open visit: met, waiting on something named, or not met and why. A kind reads tables only. It never
calls GitHub, Jev or a computer, so a move and the never-stuck check can't be stalled by the outside.

What met a requirement is its newest answer on the visit that is not undone (`answers`):

- `done`: the owner said the stage's work is finished (owner_done).
- `ok`: the named person approved. `no`: they sent it back, with notes. `again`: the owner asks them to look again.
- `give`: a stage's OK was given to another person, named in `notes`. It waits on them now.
- anything on an `answer` requirement: the choice the person picked, or what they typed. `no`, `again` and `give` are
  ordinary answers there: they steer only an OK (and a page).
- `pushed_past`: someone moved the task on without it, with the reason in `notes`. Any kind.

A requirement never waits on a person who left, was removed or cannot sign in (`active_person`): it waits on nobody named instead, and
`waiting_on` gives it to the person the task falls to.
